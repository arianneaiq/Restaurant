### Case description 

There is a restaurant that has some restrictions. This restaurant offers 5 meals. In this restaurant people 
are only welcome if they come in a group of exactly 4 persons. Every person must order exactly 1 meal. 
The restaurant-app should display how much there is to pay for the whole group. 

### User interaction 
On one part of the window, show information of the persons and on another part, information about the 
meals. It must be possible to select one of the meals for one of the persons. Use radiobuttons for this 
purpose: one for each person and one for each meal. Don’t have texts like “radiobutton1”  on it, but texts 
explaning what it is. 
Clicking a button with text “Place order” should register the person’s choice for that meal (as indicated by 
the radiobuttons). Persons can change their choice as many times as they like, until the button with text 
“make order final” is clicked. When the order is final, the total price the group has to pay for all chosen 
meals should be shown on the screen.
